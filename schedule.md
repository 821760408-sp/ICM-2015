# ICM 2015 Schedule

Each section of ICM meets for 14 sessions.  However, in order to stagger final presentations (one week before physical computing) as well as keep all sections (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday) in sync each week, there will be some slight adjustments from the usual "once-per-week" meeting.  The Tuesday sections have the most unorthodox schedule.  

Also, note that Friday, October ____, all classes will meet together for one larger "synthesis" workshop.  Details will be provided in class.
